# PyEdit
## A text editor written in Python

PyEdit is a simple Tkinter-based text editor designed for programming.

## Installation
### Important! Do not move any of the files individually. You will have to redownload if you do so.

Go to [github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/releases/latest](https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/releases/latest) and download the build for your OS (for example, Linux Build). Extract the folder from the zip and enter it.
### Linux
Make "main" executable (`chmod +x main`) and it is now ready to run! Just execute "main" to start.
### Mac & Windows
This is a portable build, so it works already! Just double-click "main" or "main.exe" when you want to run it.
### For advanced users
Go to [https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions](https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions) for the absolute latest release (Warning-very unstable!)
