# PyEdit
## A text editor written in Python

PyEdit is a simple Tkinter-based text editor designed for programming.

## Installation
### Important! Do not move any of the files individually. You will have to redownload if you do so.

Go to [github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/releases/latest](https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/releases/latest) and click on the file for your operating system (for example, Linux Build) and wait for the download to complete. Unzip the downloaded files into a new folder and enter the folder.
### Linux
Make "main" executable and it is now ready to run! Just double-click to start.
### Mac & Windows
This is a portable build, so it works already! Just double-click "main" or "main.exe" when you want to run it.
### For advanced users
Go to [https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions](github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions) for the absolute latest release (Warning-very unstable!)
