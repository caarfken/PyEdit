# PyEdit
## A text editor written in Python

PyEdit is a simple Tkinter-based text editor designed for programming.

## Installation
### Important! Do not move the "main" file. You will have to redownload if you do so.

Go to [github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions](https://github.com/caarfken/PyEdit/actions) and click on the most recently completed build (the one with the green checkmark). Click the artifact for your system (for example, Linux Build) and wait for the download to complete. Unzip the downloaded file into a new folder and enter the folder.
### Linux
Make "main" executable and it is now installed portably! Just double-click to run.
### Mac & Windows
This is a portable build, so it works already! Just double-click "main" or "main.exe" when you want to run it. You guys have it easy :)
